#
# This file is only to be used if the local environment requires that you
# run armory in "--no-docker" mode. Using no-docker mode adds considerable
# complexity to the installation and operation of armory, so we encourage the
# standard containerized version for most uses.

# Because Armory supports PyTorch, TensorFlow1, and TensorFlow2, we've
# segmented the per-platform requirements below which you should uncomment
# depending on which you use. TensorFlow1 support by Armory is deprecated and
# will be removed in a future release.

# The deepspeech asr processing requires warpctc-pytorch which is highly environment
# dependent. If you are not using that model or related, you don't need to import

#       The TF2 object detection API requires separate installation, which
#       is not simply handled by pip. Instructions can be found at
