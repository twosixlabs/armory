# Scenarios
Armory is intended to evaluate threat-model scenarios. Baseline evaluation scenarios 
are described below. Additionally, we've provided some academic standard scenarios.

## Base Scenario Class
All scenarios inherit from the [Base Armory Scenario](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory/blob/master/armory/scenarios/base.py). The 
base class parses an armory configuration file and calls a particular scenario's 
private `_evaluate` to perform all of the computation for a given threat-models 
robustness to attack. All `_evaluate` methods return a  dictionary of recorded metrics 
which are saved into the armory `output_dir` upon  completion.
 
## Baseline Scenarios
Currently the following Scenarios are available within the armory package.

### RESISC image classification

* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is assumed to be a real-time overhead imagery scene classification
system that a human operator is either passively monitoring or not monitoring at all.
* **Dataset:**
The dataset is the [NWPU RESISC-45 dataset](http://www.escience.cn/people/JunweiHan/NWPU-RESISC45.html).
It comprises 45 classes and 700 images for each class.  Images 1-500 of each class are in the training split,
500-600 are in the validation split, and 600-700 are in the test split.    
* **Baseline Model:**
To maximize time spent on defense research, a trained baseline model will be provided, but
performers are not required to use it, if their defense requires a different architecture.
The model is an ImageNet-pretrained DenseNet-121 that is fine-tuned on RESISC-45.
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Untargeted - an adversary may simply wish to evade detection
    * Targeted - an adversary may wish to divert attention or resources to scenes that are otherwise uninteresting
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non real-time, digital evasion attack - attack is not "per-example" bur "universal," which could be created
    offline (i.e., non real-time). The goal is to mimic conditions under which physical evasion attack could be carried out.
    * Black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks will be performed on defenses - for black-box attack, a held-back
    model or dataset will be used as surrogate.
  * Adversary Capabilities and Resources
    * Attacks that are non-overtly perceptible under quick glance are allowed - we assume in this scenario that 
    a human may at most passively monitor the classifier system. Use own judgement on the maximum perturbation 
    budget allowed while meeting the perceptibility requirement.
    * Type of attacks that will be implemented during evaluation: universal perturbation (untargeted attack) and 
    universal patch (targeted attack)
      * For universal patch attack, assume the total area of the patch is at most 25% of the total image area.  The 
      location and shape of the patch will vary.
* **Metrics of Interest:**
  * Primary metrics:
    * Accuracy (mean, per-class), attack computational cost, defense computational cost, various distance measures of perturbation 
    (Lp-norms, Wasserstein distance)
  * Derivative metrics - see end of document 
  * Additional metrics specific to the scenario or that are informative may be added later
* **Baseline Model Performance: (results derived using Armory < v0.10)**
  * Baseline Clean Top-1 Accuracy: 93%
  * Baseline Attacked (Universal Perturbation) Top-1 Accuracy: 6%
  * Baseline Attacked (Universal Patch) Top-1 Accuracy: 23%
* **Baseline Defense Performance: (results derived using Armory < v0.10)**

  * Baseline Clean Top-1 Accuracy: 92%
  * Baseline Attacked (Universal Perturbation) Top-1 Accuracy: 40%
  * Baseline Attacked (Universal Patch) Top-1 Accuracy: 21%

### Librispeech speaker audio classification

* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is a speaker identification system that a human operator is either
passively monitoring or not monitoring at all.
* **Dataset:**
The dataset is the [LibriSpeech dataset](http://www.openslr.org/12).
Due to the large size of the dataset, a custom subset is created.  It comprises 40 speakers (20 male/ 20 female), 
each with 4/2/2 minutes of audio in the train/validation/test splits, respectively.
* **Baseline Model:**
To maximize time spent on defense research, two trained baseline models will be provided - one based on spectrogram (not 
mel-cepstrum or MFCC) and one based on raw audio - but performers are not required to use them, if their defense 
requires a different architecture. The spectrogram-based model is developed and trained from scratch, and the 
raw audio-based model is [SincNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00158), trained from scratch.
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Untargeted - an adversary may simply wish to evade detection
    * Targeted - an adversary may wish to impersonate someone else
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non-real time, digital evasion attack - attack is not "per-example" bur rather "universal," which could be created
    offline (i.e., non real-time). The goal is to mimic conditions under which physical evasion attack could be carried out.
    * Assuming perfect acoustic channel
    * Black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks will be performed on defenses - for black-box attack, spectrogram-based
    model will be the surrogate for the raw audio-based model, and vice versa.
  * Adversary Capabilities and Resources
    * Attacks that are non-overtly perceptible under passive listening are allowed - we assume in this scenario that
    a human may at most passively monitor the classifier system. Use own judgement on the maximum perturbation budget 
    allowed while meeting the perceptibility requirement.
    * Type of attacks that will be implemented during evaluation: universal perturbation (untargeted and targeted attacks)
* **Metrics of Interest:**
  * Primary metrics:
    * Accuracy (mean, per-class), attack computational cost, defense computational cost, various distance measures of perturbation
    (Lp-norms, Wasserstein distance, signal-to-noise ratio)
  * Derivative metrics - see end of document
  * Additional metrics specific to the scenario or that are informative may be added later

### UCF101 video classification

* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is a video action recognition system that a human operator is either
passively monitoring or not monitoring at all.
* **Dataset:**
The dataset is the [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php).
It comprises 101 actions and 13,320 total videos. For the training/testing split,
we use the official Split 01.
* **Baseline Model:**
To maximize time spent on defense research, a trained baseline model will be provided, but
performers are not required to use it, if their defense requires a different architecture.
The model uses the [MARS architecture](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Crasto_MARS_Motion-Augmented_RGB_Stream_for_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf),
which is a single-stream (RGB) 3D convolution architecture that simultaneously mimics the optical flow stream. 
The provided model is pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset and fine-tuned on UCF101.
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Untargeted - an adversary may simply wish to evade detection
    * Targeted - an adversary may wish to divert attention or resources to videos that are otherwise uninteresting
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non-real time, digital evasion attack - we assume an adversary is the author of the video, so they could create an evasion attack offline
    before distributing the video.  Typically, a non real-time attack is "universal," but in this case, it is "per-example."
    * Black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks will be performed on defenses - for black-box attack, a held-back
    model or dataset will be used as surrogate.
  * Adversary Capabilities and Resources
    * Attacks that are non-overtly perceptible under quick glance are allowed, as are attacks that create perceptible
    but non-suspicious patches - we assume in this scenario that a human may at most passively monitor the classifier system.
    Use own judgement on the maximum perturbation budget allowed while meeting the perceptibility requirement.
    * Type of attacks that will be implemented during evaluation: perturbation (untargeted attack) and
    patch (targeted attack)
      * For patch attack, assume the total area of the patch is at most 25% of the total image area.  The 
      location and shape of the patch will vary.
* **Metrics of Interest:**
  * Primary metrics:
    * Accuracy (mean, per-class), attack computational cost, defense computational cost, various distance measures of perturbation
    (Lp-norms, Wasserstein distance)

  * Adversarial Patch (size <20% of video area)

### German traffic sign poisoned image classification

* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is a traffic sign recognition system that requires continuous
training, and the training data is procured through less trustworthy external sources (e.g., third-party, Internet, etc.)
and may contain backdoor triggers, where some images and labels are intentionally altered to mislead the system into 
making specific test-time decisions.
* **Dataset:**
The dataset is the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
It comprises 43 classes and more than 50,000 total images. The official Final_Training and Final_Test data are used
for the train/test split. The dataset is available in canonical format, but the official scenario applies preprocessing
consisting of contrast equalization, cropping to a square shape, and resizing.
* **Baseline Model:**
To maximize time spent on defense research, an untrained baseline model will be provided, but
performers are not required to use it, if their defense requires a different architecture.
The model uses the [MicronNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00497). Also provided will be
poison data (1/5/10% of the training size) that should be mixed with the training data.
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Targeted
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non-real time, digital evasion attack - the goal is to mimic conditions under which physical evasion attack 
    could be carried out.

    model or dataset will be used as surrogate.
  * Adversary Capabilities and Resources
    * Attacks that are non-overtly perceptible under quick glance are allowed, as are attacks that create perceptible
    but non-suspicious triggers - we assume in this scenario that a human may at most passively monitor the classifier system.

  training data have trigger added and are intentionally mislabeled with *target label*; during test time,
   the same trigger is added to an input of *source class* to cause targeted misclassification.
  * [Clean-label Backdoor Attack](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/lab/cleanlabel.pdf): 1 to 10% of the 
  *target class* in training data are imperceptibly perturbed (so they are still correctly labeled) and have 
  trigger added; during test time, same trigger is added to an input of a *source class* to cause 
  targeted misclassification

### Librispeech automatic speech recognition

* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is an automatic speech recognition system that a human operator is either
passively monitoring or not monitoring at all.

train_clean360 and test_clean.
* **Baseline Model:**
To maximize time spent on defense research, a trained baseline model will be provided, but
performers are not required to use it, if their defense requires a different architecture.
The model uses the [DeepSpeech 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02595v1.pdf) architecture with
pretrained weights from either the AN4, LibriSpeech, or TEDLIUM datasets.  Custom weights
may also be loaded by the model.
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Untargeted - an adversary may simply wish for speech to be transcribed incorrectly
    * Targeted - an adversary may wish for specific strings to be predicted
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non-real time, digital evasion attack. Each attack will be "universal" with respect to 
    channel conditions (under a single perfect channel, the attack will be "per-example.")
    * At this time, the channel model consists only a single perfect acoustic channel. 
    Realistic channel models with arbitrary impulse responses may be implemented later, 
    at which time, the attack becomes "universal."
    * Black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks will be performed on defenses.

* **Baseline Model:**
To maximize time spent on defense research, a trained baseline model will be provided, but
performers are not required to use it, if their defense requires a different architecture.
The model uses the [Faster-RCNN ResNet-50 FPN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) architecture pre-trained
on MSCOCO objects and fine-tuned on xView.

* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Untargeted - an adversary wishes to disable object detection
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non-real time, digital evasion attack - attack will be "universal" with respect to scaling, rotation, 
    and translation.
    * Black-box, white-box, and adaptive attacks will be performed on defenses.

  * Baseline mAP: 27.53% (all test examples)
  * Baseline mAP: 26.79% (1000 test examples)

Baseline defense is art_experimental.defences.JpegCompressionNormalized(clip_values=(0.0, 1.0), quality=50,
channel_index=3, apply_fit=False, apply_predict=True).\
Baseline defense performance is evaluated for a white-box attack.

### APRICOT object detection

* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is an object detector trained to identify the classes in the [Microsoft COCO dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0312.pdf).
* **Dataset:**
The dataset is the [APRICOT dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08166.pdf), which includes over 1000 natural images with physically-printed adversarial patches,
covering three object detection architectures (Faster-RCNN with ResNet-50, SSD with MobileNet, and RetinaNet),
two shapes (circle and rectangular), and ten MS-COCO classes as targets.
* **Baseline Model:**
The model uses the pretrained [Faster-RCNN with ResNet-50, SSD with MobileNet, and RetinaNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md) models.
Note: currently, only Tensorflow Faster-RCNN with ResNet-50 is implemented, with the other two architectures 
to be implemented in the near future. In order to perform as close to a white-box evaluation as possible,
it is strongly recommended, but not required, that performers adopt one of the above architectures for defense
research - the pretrained weights may not be robust, so performers can change the weights.
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * This is a dataset of precomputed adversarial images on which trained models will be evaluated.
    * Each patch is a targeted attack, whose objective is to force an object detector to localize and classify

## Creating a new scenario
Users may want to create their own scenario, because the baseline scenarios do 
not fit the requirements of some defense/threat-model, or because it may be easier 
to debug in code that you have access to as opposed to what is pre-installed by the 
armory package.

An [example of doing this](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory-example/blob/master/example_scenarios/audio_spectrogram_classification.py) can be found in our armory-examples repo:
