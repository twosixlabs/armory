## Fair use notes for RESISC-45 and UCF101
* Two Six Labs does not charge users for access to the Armory repository, 
nor the datasets therein, nor does it derive a profit directly from use of the 
datasets.
* Two Six Labs is not merely republishing the original datasets. The 
datasets have undergone transformative changes, specifically they have been 
repackaged to be integrated with Tensorflow Datasets. This repackaging 
includes, but is not limited to, processing images from compressed formats into 
binary tensors as well as decoding audio and video files. Further, Two Six Labs 
has published derived adversarial datasets that modify the original images/videos with 
small perturbations that are crafted to fool machine learning models for both 
the RESISC-45 and UCF101 datasets.
* Two Six Labs uses these datasets within Armory, however there are 
other additional datasets present, as well as multiple other features present 
in Armory beyond providing datasets.
* Two Six Labs attempted to contact the authors of RESISC-45, but received no
response.
* UCF101 direct download functionality has been used by other machine learning
frameworks, such as TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/ucf101
* Two Six Labs provides public benefit through the public distribution 
of the Armory framework to evaluate machine learning models. This material is 
based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA) under Contract No. HR001120C0114. Any opinions, findings and 
conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the 
author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
