# Docker
Armory is intended to be a lightweight python package which standardizes all evaluations
inside a docker container.


## Images
There are three docker images that are published to dockerhub for every release of 
the armory framework:

1. `twosixarmory/tf1:<version>` 
2. `twosixarmory/tf2:<version>` 
3. `twosixarmory/pytorch:<version>` 

When using `armory launch` or `armory exec` the framework specific arguments will 
utilize one of these three images. 

When running `armory run <path/to/config.json>` the image launched will be whatever is 
specified in the `docker_image` field. This enables users to extend our base images 
and run evaluations on an image that has all additional requirements for their defense.


### Custom Images

If you wish to utilize custom images for armory, these can be directly specified by
either the `"docker_image"` field of the [config file](configuration_files.md)
of `armory run <path/to/config.json>` or in the CLI of the `launch` and `exec` commands,
as in `run launch <custom_image:tag>`.

Note: since Armory executes commands on detached containers, the `CMD` of the Docker image 
will be *ignored* and replaced with `tail -f /dev/null` to ensure that the container does not
exit while those commands are being executed.

### Interactive Use

As detailed [here](index.md), it is possible to run the armory docker container in an
interactive mode using the `--interactive` CLI argument on `launch` or `run` commands.
We recommend this for debugging purposes, primarily.

When run, armory will output instructions for attaching to the container, similar to the following:
```
*** In a new terminal, run the following to attach to the container:
    docker exec -it -u 1001:1001 c10db6c70a bash
*** To gracefully shut down container, press: Ctrl-C
```
Note that `c10db6c70a` in this example is the container ID, which will change each time the
command is run. The `1001:1001` represents a mapping of users into the container, and will change
between systems and users. As stated, pressing `Ctrl-C` in that bash terminal will shut
down the container. To attach to the container, run the given command in a different bash terminal.

This will bring you into the docker container, and bring up a bash prompt there:
```
$ docker exec -it -u 1001:1001 c10db6c70a bash
groups: cannot find name for group ID 1001
I have no name!@c10db6c70a81:/workspace$
```
The groups error and the user name `I have no name!` may show up, depending on the host system, and
can be safely ignored. This is only due to host user not having a corresponding group ID inside
the container.

Once inside the container, you should be able to run or import armory as required:
```
I have no name!@c10db6c70a81:/workspace$ armory version
0.12.1-dev
I have no name!@c10db6c70a81:/workspace$ python
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 19:59:22) 
[GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import armory
>>> 
```

Note: We do not recommend using `--interactive` mode for installing custom requirements. You may 
run into permissions issues, as everything is installed as root, but the armory user is not run
as root, to prevent potential security issues. Instead, we recommend creating a custom Docker image,
as described above.

## Building Images from Source
When using a released version of armory, docker images will be pulled as needed when 
evaluations are ran. However if there are issues downloading the images (e.g. proxy) 
they can be built from the release branch of the repo:
```
git checkout -b r0.5
bash docker/build.sh <tf1|tf2|pytorch|all>
```

## Docker Volume Mounts
When launching an ARMORY instance several host directories will be mounted within the 
docker container. Note, the host directory path for datasets, saved_models, and 
outputs are configurable. To modify those directories simply run `armory configure`.
The defaults are shown below:


| Host Path   | Docker Path   | 
|:----------: | :-----------: | 
| os.getcwd() | /workspace    |  
| ~/.armory/datasets | /armory/datasets |
| ~/.armory/saved_models | /armory/saved_models |
| ~/.armory/outputs | /armory/outputs |


When using these paths in code, armory provides a programatic way to access these 
directories.

### PyTorch model persistent storage

If you are using the Armory PyTorch container, published models from PyTorch Hub
will often need to be retieved from a remote source. To avoid re-download of
that data on each container run, these will be stored in the
`/armory/saved_models/pytorch` container directory which is normally mapped to
`~/.armory/saved_models` on the host as shown in the table above. 


#### Utilizing the paths
```
from armory import paths
runtime_paths= paths.runtime_paths()
runtime_paths.dataset_dir
runtime_paths.saved_model_dir
```


## Using GPUs with Docker
Armory uses the nvidia runtime to use GPUs inside of Docker containers.

### Config GPU usage

This can be specified in JSON config files with "sysconfig" as follows:
```
    ...
    "sysconfig": {
        ...
        "gpus": "7",
        "use_gpu": true
    }
    ...
```
The `use_gpu` flag takes a boolean true/false value, and specifies whether to use the gpu or default to cpu.
The `gpus` flag is optional, and is ignored if `use_gpu` is false. If `use_gpu` is true, it defaults to using all GPUs.
    If present, the value should be a `,`-separated list of numbers specifying the GPU index in `nvidia-smi`.
    For instance, `"gpus": "2,4,7"` would enable three GPUs with indexes 2, 4, and 7.
    Setting the field to be `all` will enable use of all available gpus, i.e. `"gpus": "all"` will enable all GPUs.

### Command line GPU usage

When using the `armory` commands `run`, `launch`, or `exec`, you can specify or override the above
`use_gpu` and `gpus` fields in the config with the following command line arguments:
1) `--use_gpu`
This will enable gpu usage (it is False by default).
Using the `--gpus` argument will override this field and set it to True.

2) `--gpus`
This will enable the specified GPUs, similar to the docker `--gpus` argument.
The argument of this must be one of the following:
  a) `--gpus all` - use all GPUs
  b) `--gpus #` - use the GPU with the specified number. Example: `--gpus 2`
  c) `--gpus #,#,...,#` - use the GPUs from the comma-separated list. Example: `--gpus 1,3`
If `--gpus` is not specified, it will default to the config file if present for `run`,
and will default to `all` if not present in `run` or when using `launch` and `exec`.

Examples:
```
armory run scenario_configs/mnist_baseline.json --use-gpu
armory launch tf1 --gpus=1,4 --interactive
armory exec pytorch --gpus=0 -- nvidia-smi
```

### CUDA 

The TensorFlow versions we support require CUDA 10+.

While PyTorch does support CUDA 9, we do not recommend using it unless strictly necessary
due to an inability to upgrade your local server, and we do not have it baked in to our docker
containers. To use CUDA 9 in our docker container, you will need to replace the line
```
 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch && \
```
with
```
 cudatoolkit=9.2 -c pytorch && \
```
in `docker/pytorch/Dockerfile` and build the pytorch container locally.


## Docker Setup
Depending on the evaluation, you may need to increase the default memory allocation for 
docker containers on your system. 

Linux does not limit memory allocation, but on Mac and Windows this defaults to 2 GB 
which is likely insufficient. See the docker documentation to change this:
* [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)


## Docker Image Maintenance 
Since there are new docker images for every release of ARMORY, you may want to clean up
your docker image cache as you increase versions.

To download the current version's images ,and remove old ones, simply run:
```
armory clean --force
```

To display the set of current images on your machine, you can run:
```
docker images
```
To manually delete images, see the docs for [docker rmi](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi/).


### Docker Container Maintenance
In order to see the set of containers that are running, run:
```
docker ps
```
ARMORY will attempt to gracefully shut down all containers it launches;
however, certain errors may prevent shutdown and leave running containers.
To shut down these containers, please see the docs for 
[docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/) 
and [docker kill](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/kill/).

## Running without docker

Armory has partial support for users wishing to run without docker. Currently, the
`armory run` command can be run without Docker in Linux environments. To run without
docker, either set the `docker_image` field to be null in the scenario
configuration json file, or call `armory run` with the --no-docker option.

Armory can also download and use datasets without docker. To use the download command,
simply add the `--no-docker` option, which will skip downloading the images and
run it in host mode:
```
armory download <path/to/scenario-set1.json> --no-docker
```

After datasets have been downloaded, they can be used outside of docker by setting
the pathing mode to host in python:
```python
from armory import paths
paths.set_mode("host")
from armory.data import datasets
ds = datasets.mnist()
x, y = next(ds)
```

### Environment setup
NOTE: The listing of libraries needed for Armory when run on host is available at
`host-requirements.txt`. You will need to manually install the requirements in
that file that match your framework (TF1, TF2, PyTorch).
