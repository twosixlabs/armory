# Formatting
All contributions to the repository must be formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black).
```
black .
```

All JSON files committed to the repository must be formatted using the following command:
```
python -m tools.format_json
```
It is based off of Python's [json.tool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool)
with the `--sort-keys` argument, though overcomes an issue in 3.6 which made it unable to rewrite
the file it was reading from.

We use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for non-formatting PEP style enforcement.
```
flake8
```
Our repo-specific Flake8 configuration is detailed in `.flake8`.

Our repo uses [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for enforcement of YAML
syntax and formatting.
```
yamllint --no-warnings
```

Our repo-specific configuration for yamllint is found in `.yamllint`.

### Pre-commit Hooks

If you want those tools to run automatically before each commit, run:
```bash
cat tools/pre-commit.sh > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod 755 .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

# Import Style
Imports in python files should be organized into three blocks, after the docstring, and before other code:
* Block 1: built-in package imports
* Block 2: external package imports
* Block 3: internal package imports
These blocks should be separated by a single empty line. Here is an example:
```python
"""
Docstring
"""

import json
import logging
import os

import requests
import numpy as np
from art import defences

from armory.docker.management import ManagementInstance                                   
from armory.utils.external_repo import download_and_extract_repos


logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# ...
```

Exceptions are allowed for import error handling, required import ordering, or in-class/function imports.
