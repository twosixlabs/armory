# Train set splitting utilities

# Given a dataset with only two splits - train and test, these utilities divide the train set
# into subsets following a generalized version of the logic from the Bullseye Polytope
# attack, which in turn borrows the logic from the Convex Polytope attack, available at
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05897.pdf for CIFAR10. The motivating idea is, to benchmark
# an attack it is important to repeat the experiment with multiple targets (recall
# the target is a single datapoint). For consistency each experiment should train
# on identical images (except for the poisons), and for measurement purposes the benign performance
# on the test set is measured against only the test set. So the poisons (whose exact number
# will vary based on the strength of the attack) should be pulled from a fixed subset of the
# training data, as should the targets. The paper also describes using a subset of the dataset
# to fine-tune on - since this is not a realistic use case of fine-tuning, the utility methods
# do not implement this functionality.
